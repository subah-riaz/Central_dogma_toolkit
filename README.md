# Central Dogma Toolkit 

**Central Dogma Toolkit** is a Python application built with Tkinter that analyzes biological sequences by mimicking the *central dogma of molecular biology* — the flow of genetic information from **DNA → RNA → Protein**.

##  What This Tool Does

This toolkit allows you to:

1. Identify whether a sequence is DNA or RNA  
2. Transcribe DNA into RNA  
3. Split sequences into **codons** (three-base units)  
4. Find **Open Reading Frames (ORFs)**  
5. Translate sequences into protein strings based on codons

This helps you simulate the fundamental biological processes of **transcription and translation**, the two key steps in gene expression.

##  Biological Background

In biology, the **central dogma** describes how genetic information stored in DNA is used to build proteins:

1. **Transcription** – DNA is copied into RNA  
2. **Translation** – RNA is read in sets of three bases (codons) to build proteins

This flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein is fundamental to life.
